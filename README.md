# Welcome to the 3D SVG Playground!

Ever wondered what would happen if your plain old SVGs suddenly grew legs and stepped into the third dimension? Welcome! This project takes your humble flat SVG files and turns them into vibrant, interactive 3D models—kind of like giving your art a superhero origin story.

## What Is This Project?

This is a Next.js-powered playground where 2D vectors get their 3D groove on. Whether you're here to experiment, create, or just enjoy the quirky transformation process, we promise a journey that's as fun as it is innovative.

## Key Features

- **SVG Upload Made Easy:** Just drag, drop, and let the magic happen.
- **Instant 3D Transformation:** Witness your flat images morph into interactive 3D models.
- **Editing Fun:** Tweak your models effortlessly—no magic wand required, just a few clicks.
- **Responsive Design:** Works smoothly on desktops and mobiles, because great art shouldn’t be confined to one screen size.
